    <h1>Founders and Coders application project</h1>
    <p>This project is for an application to Founders and Coders. Please find a link the home page <a href="https://curious-liberal.github.io/curious-liberal/src/index.html">here</a></p>

    <h1>Application requirements</h1>
    <p>My plan is to take these concepts and merge them into a singular project.</p>

    <h2 id="website">Website</h2>
    <p>Your first project is to build a showcase website. Your website should:</p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
        <li>Tell us about you;</li>
        <li>Talk about why you’d like to move into a career as a web developer;</li>
        <li>Showcase what you’ve learnt so far;</li>
        <li>Be built <i>only</i> using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;</li>
        <li>Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes);</li>
        <li>Be hosted on GitHub Pages;</li><li>Link back to the GitHub repo with the code for your website.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a very open ended project. We really welcome your creativity in this; it’s your opportunity to show off with a website about you!</p>

    <h2 id="game">Game</h2>
    <p>Your second project is to construct a game. Your game should:</p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
        <li>Be built <i>only</i> using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;</li>
        <li>Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes)</li>
        <li>Be original and engaging (e.g. not made <i>solely</i> using a tutorial, but it can be inspired by existing games);</li>
        <li>Actually work! We need to be able to play it once it’s deployed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We're interested in seeing how you <b>incorporate different complex parts that interact with each other</b>.</p>
    <p>This project will challenge your problem-solving skills and <b>showcase your creativity</b>. We are not providing examples because we want to see your unique approach and creativity.</p>

    <h3>Things to consider:</h3>
    <p>Think about the fundamental elements of a game: user interaction, rules, win/lose conditions, and perhaps a scoring system.</p><p>As you design your game, ask yourself:</p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
        <li>How will the user interact with your game? (for ex. mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or a combination of both)</li>
        <li>What are the rules of your game?</li>
        <li>What makes it challenging or engaging?</li>
        <li>How does a player win or lose in your game? (for ex. is there a scoring system?)</li>
        <li>How does your game remain fresh and engaging?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Codewars</h2>
    <p>Before you can apply to our programme, you'll need to reach 6 kyu on <a href="https://codewars.com/">Codewars</a>. This is a platform for training in JavaScript by completing challenges known as kata.</p>
    <p>As you complete the challenges, you'll earn points. Points allow you to advance up the different ranks, called <i>kyu</i>. You will start at rank 8 kyu and will need to advance to <b>6 kyu</b>.</p>
    <p>We have no specific challenges for you to complete, but <b>we recommend working through the most popular challenges for your kyu</b>. If you’d rather do others, go ahead!</p>
    <p>Codewars can be tough, but it’s a great learning platform to get confident in JavaScript. The challenges can vary drastically, as they are all submitted by users. The ranks don't always reflect the difficulty. If you're stuck on a kata for a long time and don't feel like you're making progress, you may want to move onto a different one instead - or try <a href="https://account.foundersandcoders.com/apply/requirements/overview#approaching-problems">asking for help</a>.</p>

    <h2>Deadline</h2>
    <p>Submit by 31st July 2025 to join the September cohort.</p>

    <h1>Project plan</h1>
    <p>The plan is rather loose and lacking verbosity and context as it&#39;s rather straight forward and not something I need to collaborate on.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Responsive biographical website featuring profile pictures, links to social media, bio section and pages widgets which lead to other pages detailing various hobbies e.g. climbing, tech, bushcraft, magic, art, music, cooking. Each widget must include a featured image, title and description or truncated contents if a description is missing. Hobby pages should be created in JSON format and rendered into HTML using JavaScript; this allows us to easily turn it into a Markdown editor like AnyType, Logeq, Notion etc later on.</p>

    <h1>Tasklist</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled checked="checkbox">Design UI</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled checked="checkbox">Build static home page with profile pic, bio, links and widgets</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled checked="checked">Create widget functionality</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled>Create pages for each widget</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled>Add light theme, dark theme button</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled>Cause 404 page to become gamified music player which transforms player controls into pong-like paddle</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled>Setup Node server (don&#39;t use express as no external libraries) with custom 404 pages</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled>Deploy on servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Extension</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled>Create new branch - use current profile as demo profile which is stored in local storage. Allow other users to create their own profile, edit profile picture, bio, links, add new widgets and have access to markdown editor.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled>Extra extension that&#39;ll never happen because I&#39;m too busy (new branch) - setup user account creation, cloud service and configure with CloudFlare API to allow users to buy domain, login publish site etc.</li>
    </ul>
