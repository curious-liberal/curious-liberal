                <h1>Magic ðŸª„</h1>
                <p>Since I can remember I was performing. Whether it was magic, music, comedy; I just love to perform. Entertaining people and seeing them smile means the world to me. Magic is something I've developed over the years as a way of making ordinary life...well..magical. Shoe laces look boring until you link them together. Paper looks boring until it's suddenly flying round the room. Piegons are often ignored until they're produced out of thin air. The world is magical most people just don't know it yet!</p>

        <h1>Cute picture of me as a kid</h1>
        <p>Below is a picture of little me with a card inside in orange. I'd invited my grandparents round as I was cooking dinner. Being me, I had to provide some evening entertainment so I had them pick a card, sign it, go downstairs and pick a fruit and after cutting it they discovered their signed card inside.</p>

        <h1>My favourite moment in magic</h1>
        <p>This is my favourite moment in magic, <b>EVER!!</b></p>
        <p>I was at The Bushcraft festival and I performed magic, it was so fun. Here's the video. You definitely want to see this!! I ended up hypnotising some of the most elite, highly ranked military personnel in the UK as well as morphing playing cards into very interesting objects...</p>
