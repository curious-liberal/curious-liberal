                <h1>Climbing ðŸ§—</h1>
                <p>Climbing is my happy place! Coding can be great as it challenges me mentally but climbing challenges me physically whilst stimulating me with problem solving. Keeping fit is really important to me and I've never been much of a gym guy; I just find it so boring ðŸ¥±. Since I can remember I've been climbing up trees, tying knots etc. Mother had to convice my very displeased ten year old self not to abseil down the house <b>many, many</b> times ðŸ˜†</p>

        <h1>My favourite top rope rigs</h1>
        <p>For those of you that don't know top roping (it's technically bottom roping but everyone gets it wrong) is where you setup the rope at the top of your climb beforehand so it drapes down to the start of your climb. See image below</p>
