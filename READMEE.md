# Founders and Coders application project
This project is for an application to Founders and Coders. Please find a link the home page [here](https://curious-liberal.github.io/curious-liberal/src/index.html)

# Application requirements
My plan is to take these concepts and merge them into a singular project

## Website
Your first project is to build a showcase website. Your website should:
Tell us about you;
Talk about why you’d like to move into a career as a web developer;
Showcase what you’ve learnt so far;
Be built only using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;
Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes);
Be hosted on GitHub Pages;
Link back to the GitHub repo with the code for your website.
This is a very open ended project. We really welcome your creativity in this; it’s your opportunity to show off with a website about you!

## Game
GAME
Your second project is to construct a game. Your game should:
Be built only using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;
Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes)
Be original and engaging (e.g. not made solely using a tutorial, but it can be inspired by existing games);
Actually work! We need to be able to play it once it’s deployed.
We're interested in seeing how you incorporate different complex parts that interact with each other.
This project will challenge your problem-solving skills and showcase your creativity. We are not providing examples because we want to see your unique approach and creativity.
THINGS TO CONSIDER:
Think about the fundamental elements of a game: user interaction, rules, win/lose conditions, and perhaps a scoring system.
As you design your game, ask yourself:
How will the user interact with your game? (for ex. mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or a combination of both)
What are the rules of your game?
What makes it challenging or engaging?
How does a player win or lose in your game? (for ex. is there a scoring system?)
How does your game remain fresh and engaging?
Remember, we’re looking for features that you have built yourself. This is your chance to create something that showcases not only your coding skills but also your passion and creativity.
Lastly, find joy in the process! One of the most important aspects of this task is that you enjoy building and playing your game. We're excited to see what you come up with!


## Codewars
CODEWARS
Before you can apply to our programme, you'll need to reach 6 kyu on Codewars. This is a platform for training in JavaScript by completing challenges known as kata.
As you complete the challenges, you'll earn points. Points allow you to advance up the different ranks, called kyu. You will start at rank 8 kyu and will need to advance to 6 kyu.
We have no specific challenges for you to complete, but we recommend working through the most popular challenges for your kyu. If you’d rather do others, go ahead!
Codewars can be tough, but it’s a great learning platform to get confident in JavaScript. The challenges can vary drastically, as they are all submitted by users. The ranks don't always reflect the difficulty. If you're stuck on a kata for a long time and don't feel like you're making progress, you may want to move onto a different one instead - or try asking for help.


## Deadline
Submit by 31st July 2025 to join the September cohort.

# Project plan
The plan is rather loose and lacking verbosity and context as it's rather straight forward and not something I need to collaborate on.

## Description
Responsive biographical website featuring profile pictures, links to social media, bio section and pages widgets which lead to other pages detailing various hobbies e.g. climbing, tech, bushcraft, magic, art, music, cooking. Each widget must include a featured image, title and description or truncated contents if a description is missing. Hobby pages should be created in JSON format and rendered into HTML using JavaScript; this allows us to easily turn it into a Markdown editor like AnyType, Logeq, Notion etc later on.

# Tasklist
[x] Design UI
[x]. Build static home page with profile pic, bio, links and widgets
[x] Create widget functionality
[ ] Create pages for each widget
[ ] Add light theme, dark theme button
[ ] Cause 404 page to become gamified music player which transforms player controls into pong-like paddle
[ ] Setup Node server (don't use express as no external libraries) with custom 404 pages
[ ] Deploy on servers

## Extension
[ ] Create new branch - use current profile as demo profile which is stored in local storage. Allow other users to create their own profile, edit profile picture, bio, links, add new widgets and have access to markdown editor.
[ ] Extra extension that'll never happen because I'm too busy (new branch) - setup user account creation, cloud service and configure with CloudFlare API to allow users to buy domain, login publish site etc.
